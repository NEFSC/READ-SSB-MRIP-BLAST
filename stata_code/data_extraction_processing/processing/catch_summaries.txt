Here are number of trips in Calendar Year 2020. No trips in Jan -March that caught or targeted GOM cod or GOM haddock.
<<dd_do>>

And here are the trips for 2021.  No trips in Jan -March that caught or targeted GOM cod or GOM haddock.
<<dd_do>>
global working_year 2021
use "${my_outputdir}/`my_common1'_`my_common2'_target_${working_year}.dta", replace
sort year month 
list year month dtrip
<</dd_do>>

April 2020 is very different from April 2021, for COVID reasons.  However, July 2020 has a massive number of trips compared to July of 2021.  Apart from those two numbers, the effort data looks pretty similar. I think it's reasonable to calibrate the model to the 2021 data.  Months 9+10 will be available soon. And we can use month 11 from 2020.  We will also have to use April 2021 as a proxy for April 2022.


Here are trips, by fishing year:




<<dd_do>>
use "${FY_dir}/FY_targeting.dta", replace
/* 2018 has partial data in it (From April of 2019)*/
drop if fishing_year<2019
list
<</dd_do>>
There were alot of trips in 2020!  FY 2021 data is partial, but if it continues at the 2020 pace, we should expect 371,942 trips.
